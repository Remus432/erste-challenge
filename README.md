# ui-ux-engineer-exercise
Welcome to 3rd round of UI/UX Engineer job role interview.

In this part we would like to see your knowledge of HTML/CSS/SCSS and you will be coding according to provided designs and design specifications.

Exercise is hosted on github, please create a branch with your name based on master branch and pull it.

In order to have working project, please make sure that you have git and NodeJS (version 10+) installed. After pulling a branch, please run 'npm install' first and then the only thing you need to do is start a "start:dev" script ("webpack-dev-server") that handles HTML and SASS compilation and also do a live reload. Project page can be reached on "localhost:8080".

Source files are located in "src" folder, designs with specification in "_designs" folder. Please feel free to add any files, folders, code, variables, etc. to keep the code as cleanest as possible and as structured as possible and the final result should as close to the design as possible.

Your HTML will go to "index.html" to "main" element.

Good luck!
