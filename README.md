# Welcome to the 2nd round of Frontend Developer job role interview.

In this part we would like to see your **knowledge of HTML/(S)CSS** and your task will be to code a part of the website according to provided designs and design specifications (your task is to create the main "middle" part between aready existing header and footer).

Exercise is hosted on github, please create a branch with your name (e.g. john-doe) and checkout master branch into it.

## Project setup

In order to have the project running, please **make sure that you have git and NodeJS (version 10+) installed**. After the checkout, please run `npm install` first and then the only thing you need to do is start a `start:dev` script ("webpack-dev-server") that handles HTML and SASS compilation and also do a live reload. Project page can be reached on `localhost:8080`.

## Project structure

Source files are located in "src" folder, designs with specification in "_designs" folder. Please feel free to add any files, folders, code, variables, etc. to keep the code as cleanest as possible and as structured as possible and the final result should as close to the design as possible. You can use all the variables that are already in place.

Your HTML will go to "index.html" to "main" element.

**Good luck!** :crossed_fingers:
